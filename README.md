# Timer-and-Stop-watch
I recently completed a challenging and exciting front-end project as part of my web development internship at Codeclause. The project, called Stop_Watch_and_Countdown_Timer, is a dynamic and responsive website that serves as both a stopwatch and a countdown timer. The project was built using a simple yet powerful combination of pure HTML, CSS, and javascript, also known as "vanilla javascript." Through this mini-project, I gained valuable hands-on experience with this cutting-edge technology and honed my web development skills.

Working on the Stop_Watch_and_Countdown_Timer project was an incredible experience. It allowed me to showcase my creativity and problem-solving skills by developing a sleek and functional website that serves a practical purpose. I was challenged to implement responsive design principles to ensure the website looks great on all devices, and to leverage the power of javascript to create smooth and seamless user experiences.

In the end, I'm thrilled with the result and can't wait to apply the lessons I've learned to future web development projects.
